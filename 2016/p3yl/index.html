<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
Provenance Week 2016 will take place three years after the publication of the PROV recommendations and notes. The purpose of this workshop is twofold: 1) to collect practical experiences with using PROV in real-world applications so that we can take stock of its impact, and 2) to identify interoperability challenges with the current PROV specifications.  The aim is to develop a community consensus around the priorities for PROV.

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Provenance, defined as a record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing, is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In many environments, such as the Web or the medical context where users find information that is uncertain or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.</p>

<p>In 2013, the World Wide Web Consortium published PROV, a standard for expressing, sharing, and discovering provenance on the Web. It consists of a conceptual data model (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/">PROV-DM</a>), an OWL2 ontology (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROV-O</a>), a textual notation (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-n/">PROV-N</a>), a set of constraints to check the consistency of provenance (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-constraints/">PROV-CONSTRAINTS</a>), an XML schema (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-xml/">PROV-XML</a>), conventions for sharing and discovering provenance (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-aq/">PROV-AQ</a>), and various other more focused specifications. Since then, PROV has seen adoption in some flagship applications, continued strong interest by the academic community, and promising tentative take-up in other standardization organizations, such as <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/provenance.html">HL7</a> and <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/ows-10">OGC</a>.</p>

<p>Three years later, it is time for provenance practitioners to take stock, reflect on their practical experiences with using PROV in their applications, understand the impact of PROV, and identify interoperability challenges and shortcomings with the current specifications. We invite the community to submit short position statements, which will be presented in "lightning talks" at a workshop on June 6, during Provenance Week. Talks will be grouped by topics of interest. The workshop organisers will act as facilitators, with the aim to develop a community consensus around the priorities for PROV. Position statements will be published online as a record of the workshop.</p>

<h3>Submission Procedure</h3>

<p>
Submit short position statements (ideally less than a page) through <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pw2016">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pw2016</a> (please select the track "PROV: Three Years Later"). </p>

<p>HTML or any format is welcome. Authors may want to submit documents in HTML, using the <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash">RASH framework</a> (Research Articles in Simplified HTML).  Mutliple submissions for different experiences and/or requirements are welcome. As we are keen to gather as many experiences and requirements as possible, it is acceptable for authors to submit position statements, even if they cannot physically attend the workshop, as long as they inform the organizers.
